                TradeCapture AI is a mobile application designed to revolutionize how sales teams capture and qualify
                leads at tradeshows. The app uses a sophisticated multi-agent AI architecture to handle business card
                scanning, conversation analysis, lead qualification, and CRM integrationâ€”all while functioning reliably
                in environments with poor connectivity.
              </p>
              <p>
                What makes this project particularly interesting from a technical perspective is that we delivered a
                complex, AI-powered application with a small team of just two developers and one product manager in only
                six weeks.

              <p>
                The core of TradeCapture AI is a multi-agent system where specialized AI components work together to
                provide a seamless experience. Each agent handles a specific aspect of the lead capture process:
              </p>

              <h3>Multi-Agent AI System</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Recognition Agent:</strong> Handles OCR processing of business cards and badges with custom
                  post-processing to improve accuracy in poor lighting conditions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Conversation Agent:</strong> Processes audio transcriptions in real-time, extracts key
                  information, and generates follow-up questions based on industry-specific knowledge bases.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Qualification Agent:</strong> Analyzes conversation data to score leads based on customizable
                  criteria and buying signals, with a feedback loop for continuous improvement.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Integration Agent:</strong> Handles data formatting and synchronization with various CRM
                  systems through a unified API adapter pattern.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                These agents are coordinated by an orchestration layer that manages their interactions and maintains a
                shared context. Here's a simplified version of the agent orchestrator:

          <section className="mb-16">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Technical Challenges</h2>
            <div className="prose prose-invert max-w-none">
              <h3>Offline Functionality</h3>
              <p>
                One of the biggest challenges was ensuring the app would function reliably in tradeshow environments
                with poor or intermittent connectivity. We implemented a sophisticated offline-first architecture using
                WatermelonDB for local storage with custom sync conflict resolution algorithms.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our solution included a queue-based synchronization system that prioritizes critical data and uses
                exponential backoff for retry attempts, reducing battery consumption by 40%. We also developed a custom
                merge strategy for handling conflicting updates when multiple devices sync with the server after being
                offline.
              </p>

              <h3>Real-time Audio Processing</h3>
              <p>
                Processing conversation audio in noisy tradeshow environments presented significant technical hurdles.
                We implemented a custom audio processing pipeline with noise cancellation and speaker separation using
                WebRTC and TensorFlow.js.
              </p>
              <p>
                The system processes audio in 3-second chunks while maintaining context across segments, reducing
                latency by 65%. We also developed a hybrid processing approach that uses on-device models for initial
                filtering and cloud processing for deeper analysis, balancing accuracy and battery life.
              </p>
            </div>

          {/* Customization Engine */}
          <section className="mb-16">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Customization Engine</h2>
            <div className="prose prose-invert max-w-none">
              <p>
                A key technical achievement was developing a flexible customization system that allows clients to
                configure the app for different events and selling patterns without code changes. This includes:
              </p>

              <h3>Event-Specific Configurations</h3>
              <p>
                We built a JSON-based configuration system with a web admin interface that allows clients to define
                custom fields for different event types, set up event-specific qualification criteria, configure
                branding and UI elements, and create custom follow-up templates.
              </p>

              <h3>AI Prompt Templates</h3>
              <p>
                We developed a sophisticated prompt engineering system that allows for industry-specific conversation
                templates, product-specific question generators, customizable objection handling prompts, and dynamic
                context injection based on conversation flow.
              </p>

              <h3>Integration Framework</h3>
              <p>
                We built a pluggable integration system with adapters for multiple CRM platforms (Salesforce, HubSpot,
                etc.), marketing automation tools, custom webhook endpoints, and data transformation pipelines.

            <div className="prose prose-invert max-w-none">
              <p>
                With a tight timeline of just 1.5 months and a small team (2 developers and 1 product manager), we
                adopted a highly efficient development process:
              </p>

              <h3>Rapid Development Approach</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Week 1-2:</strong> Core architecture setup, including the agent framework, database schema,
                  and basic UI components.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Week 3-4:</strong> Implementation of the recognition and conversation agents, offline
                  functionality, and basic customization engine.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Week 5-6:</strong> Integration framework, qualification agent, advanced customization
                  features, and performance optimization.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Technical Practices</h3>
              <p>We employed several technical practices to maintain quality while moving quickly:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Modular Architecture:</strong> Used a feature-based folder structure with clear boundaries
                  between modules, enabling parallel development.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Automated Testing:</strong> Implemented Jest for unit tests and Detox for E2E testing, with a
                  focus on critical paths and edge cases.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>CI/CD Pipeline:</strong> Set up GitHub Actions for continuous integration with automated
                  builds and deployments to TestFlight and internal testing channels.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Feature Flags:</strong> Implemented a feature flag system to safely deploy features
                  incrementally and conduct A/B testing in production.
                </li>

            <div className="prose prose-invert max-w-none">
              <h3>Adaptive AI Context Management</h3>
              <p>
                We developed a novel approach to managing context in AI conversations that dynamically adjusts based on
                the conversation flow. This includes a sliding context window with importance-based retention, entity
                extraction and relationship mapping, topic detection for context switching, and memory compression for
                token optimization. This approach reduced token usage by 47% while maintaining context quality.
              </p>

              <h3>Hybrid OCR Processing</h3>
              <p>
                We created a multi-stage OCR system that combines multiple approaches for maximum accuracy, including
                on-device ML for initial text detection, cloud-based OCR for detailed extraction, AI-powered
                post-processing for error correction, and structured data extraction with custom regex patterns. This
                system achieved 99.2% accuracy in field extraction, even in challenging lighting conditions.
